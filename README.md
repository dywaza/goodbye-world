# goodbye-world
People keep writing "hello world" programs, but the inverse name is so much darker.


this is a file where i can write about myself while i try to learn how to use github.
several questions: one, this stuff is free. how the hell do they pay for all that cloud storage?
second, how come this is the industry standard? is "git" synonymous with github? is it just like something that was created by God, and has always existed as just some kind of feature across all computers? How the heck does it work?

i dunno, i'm too tired for this. goodbye, world.
